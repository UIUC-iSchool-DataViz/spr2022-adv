description: Conceptualize, Prototype and Implement a Ticket to Ride game state visualizer
---

You have until April 19th.

 * Continue your conceptualization of a game state visualizer, building on what we did in class.
   * Start with the prototype developed in class.
   * If necessary, "clean up" and present it in a clean, annotated fashion.
   * Describe (in words) what you had envisioned, and the various different shortcomings and advantages it has.
   * Describe what you would do differently next time.
 * "Instantiate" this prototype for at least two game states.
   * You can utilize the game states in class.
   * This can be a prototype as well, but should have the various items filled out as it would in a real game.
   * Use your "cleaned up" version.
 * Implement this as a working visualization, using one of our platforms.
   * If you *are not* able to fully realize your vision, describe what you tried, and how you approached the problem.
   * How responsive is your visualization?  How much interactivity can you imagine for a static game state? (Any?)
   * What would you have liked to do that you did not?
   * Most importantly, how would this experience feed back into your prototyping phase?

If possible, deploy as a static site on Github.  If not possible, provide source code in a Github repository.
